This game was inspired by a freeware OSX game I found back in 2007 called 'Primate Plunge'. It's made by Aelius games and can be seen here: http://www.aelius.com/primateplunge/.

The game is pretty simple, you control a monkey falling through the jungle, grabbing limbs as you fall. If you miss and fall to the bottom, the game is over. There's also a trampoline that appears to bounce you up a little and help grab the next branch. I'm not sure why there's a trampoline in the jungle, but it's in the original game. ;) Your score increases as you grab tree branches.
